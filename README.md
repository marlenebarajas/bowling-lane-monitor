# bowling-lane-monitor
## Problem Statement
Design entities and interfaces to model a scoreboard controller for bowling, keeping in mind the nature of the input from the physical machinery in the bowling lane, which generally reflects game and/or pin state.
The input to the scoreboard controller is the lane control hardware that reflects the pin state (i.e. how many pins are up/down).
